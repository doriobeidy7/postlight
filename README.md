Small project will show implementation between nodeJS server and postgres database
As Front end we are using iOS Swift 
```


# Database

# Server - NodeJS
https://github.com/doriobeidy7/postlight/tree/create_emp_db/nodejs-server

# iOS Project Demo

```
NB: This project after installation will load only locally as localhost:3001
    The iOS will run only on the simulator
    The server will need hosting to make the app running on iOS Device
